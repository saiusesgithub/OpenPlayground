# AlgoVis - Ultimate Algorithm Visualizer

A comprehensive visualization tool for understanding computer science fundamentals. Built entirely with the Vanilla Web Stack (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript).

## Features
- **Sorting Visualizer**: Includes Bubble Sort and a fully recursive Merge Sort.
- **Pathfinding**: Implements Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm on a 40x25 grid.
- **Data Structures**: Interactive Stack and Queue visualization with sliding animations.
- **Customization**: Real-time speed control and array/grid size adjustments.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The UI structure and dashboard.
- `style.css`: Custom animations and responsive layout.
- `script.js`: The heavy-lifting engine with 800+ lines of algorithmic logic.
- `project.json`: Metadata for portfolio integration.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Select a tab (Sorting/Pathfinding/DS).
3. Adjust the speed and size settings.
4. Click **Visualize** to watch the algorithm work!
